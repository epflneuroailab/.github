# EPFL NeuroAI Lab

We are the NeuroAI research group at the EPFL [Neuro-X Institute](https://neuro-x.epfl.ch/en/), jointly between the [School of Life Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/), and the [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://ic.epfl.ch/).

Our research focuses on a computational understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying human natural intelligence. 
To achieve this goal, we bridge Deep Learning, Neuroscience, and Cognitive Science, 
building artificial neural network models that match the brainâ€™s neural representations in their internal processing and are aligned to human behavior in their outputs.
